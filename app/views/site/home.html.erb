      <p class="vcenter">Hello and welcome! I am a developer based in the Bay Area, where I primarily work on the backend with the LAMP stack and Javascript frameworks such as React on the frontend. I graduated from the University of California in San Diego with two degrees in computer science and computing
        arts. I recently picked up Ruby on Rails and I'm loving every bit of it. When I'm not coding, I love to plan trips and travel the world
        with my 6D. If you would like to collaborate on a project or recommend a spot to take photos, please don't hesitate to contact me below!

            write a paragraph saying what I have to say about the job?
