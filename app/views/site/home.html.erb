      <p class="vcenter">Hello and welcome! I am a developer based in the Bay Area, where I primarily work on the backend with the LAMP stack and Javascript frameworks such as React on the frontend. I graduated from the University of California in San Diego with two degrees in computer science and computing
        arts. I recently picked up Ruby on Rails and I'm loving every bit of it. When I'm not coding, I love to plan trips and travel the world
        with my 6D. If you would like to collaborate on a project or recommend a spot to take photos, please don't hesitate to contact me below!

              During my last year at UCSD, I developed a graphical user interface application, MatEdit,
              for programmers to determine the most accurate parameters and produce a more realistic
              3D rendering in OpenGL. As a student researcher, I collected data and properties of
              real-world objects and their surfaces to generate a library of materials that can be applied to
              OpenGL primitive types. MatEdit reduced the amount of time spent coding for developers, allowing them more time
              to focus on project simulations and testing.
